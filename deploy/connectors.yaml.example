# Example connector configuration for RemoteLLM Broker
#
# This file maps connector authentication tokens to their LLM API keys.
# Each connector authenticates with a token, and the broker injects the
# corresponding LLM API key into requests before forwarding to the connector.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to /etc/remotellm/connectors.yaml (Linux) or
#      /usr/local/etc/remotellm/connectors.yaml (macOS)
#   2. Replace tokens and API keys with your actual values
#   3. Configure the broker to use this file via --connector-config or
#      REMOTELLM_BROKER_CONNECTOR_CONFIG environment variable
#
# Security notes:
#   - This file contains sensitive API keys - protect it accordingly
#   - Set restrictive permissions: chmod 600 connectors.yaml
#   - The token is used by the connector to authenticate to the broker
#   - The llm_api_key is injected into requests to the LLM provider

connectors:
  # Connector for OpenAI-compatible LLM
  - token: "connector-token-1"
    llm_api_key: "sk-your-openai-api-key-here"

  # Connector for another LLM provider
  - token: "connector-token-2"
    llm_api_key: "your-other-api-key-here"

  # Connector without API key (for LLMs that don't require auth)
  - token: "connector-token-3"
    # llm_api_key omitted - requests forwarded without auth header
